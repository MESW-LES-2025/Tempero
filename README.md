# Product vision board

## Vision
To create a cooking community that empowers users to **discover, review and share recipes**, encouraging skill growth and creativity in the kitchen through **gamification and smart recommendations**.

> “Cook, review and level up your culinary journey.”

---

## Target group
**Primary users:**
- Cooking enthusiasts of all skill levels: from beginners to experts.
- Home cooks seeking to improve through structured progression.
- Users who enjoy reviewing and sharing experiences online.

**Secondary users:**
- Chefs or food bloggers looking to showcase recipes.
- Brands or culinary schools wanting to engage with an active cooking community.

**Market context:**
- Existing solutions: there are recipe sites (for example Tasty) but they lack social engagement, parameterized reviews and skill tracking.
- Market need: a platform merging **social interaction + gamified learning + recipe management**.

---

## Needs
- Central place to **share and discover new recipes**.
- Ability to **evaluate recipes fairly** (difficulty, time, quality).
- Desire for **progression and recognition** (levels, achievements).
- Social connection: follow friends, exchange reviews, build community.

**Main problem solved:**
> “Recipe websites don’t motivate users to improve because they just show instructions and most times the user behind the recipe is unknown.  
> Tempero helps you *learn, track and grow* your cooking skills while being connected to your friends.”
